We used an enhanced version of the publicly available OPEN-I Chest X-ray dataset, obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 93,347 image–report pairs for training, 1,885 pairs for validation, and 1,541 images for testing. Each study includes a chest X-ray image and a corresponding textual radiology report describing Findings (anatomical/pathological observations) and Impression (clinical interpretation).
